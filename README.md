ToxiChecker  - A project contributing to safer and faster drug development pipelines
Vihit Shah (Suncity School XII-F)


The increasing reliance on computational methods in drug discovery has highlighted the need for accurate toxicity prediction systems.
Traditional experimental toxicity testing is costly, time-consuming, and ethically challenging due to reliance on animal models.
To address these limitations, I have developed ToxiChecker as a machine learningâ€“based tool designed to classify chemical compounds as toxic or non-toxic using molecular data.
The project leverages the Tox21 and PubChem dataset, which contains labelled SMILES strings, to train predictive models capable of identifying patterns linked to toxicity.
Various preprocessing techniques, including feature extraction from SMILES and class balancing strategies, are employed to improve model accuracy.
The system implements multiple algorithms, ranging from Random Forests, Morgan fingerprinting, Tanimoto similarities and molecular visualization to advanced deep learning approaches, and evaluates their performance using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and a confidence percentage.
ToxiChecker is designed with practical applications in mind, enabling pharmaceutical researchers to screen large libraries of compounds efficiently and reduce the need for extensive laboratory testing.
By integrating cheminformatics with artificial intelligence, the project contributes to safer and faster drug development pipelines.
Ultimately, ToxiChecker demonstrates how data-driven approaches can support the discovery of non-toxic therapeutic agents, minimizing risks while accelerating innovation in biomedical research.

I've curated my own dataset of approximately 4000 toxic and non toxic molecules which I've used to train a machine learning model
